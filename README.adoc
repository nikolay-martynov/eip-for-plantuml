= EIP sprites for PlantUML

[WARNING]
This is work in progress.

This is inspired by unofficial PlantUML EIP library
by _aheil_ https://github.com/aheil/EIP-PlantUML

The difference is that it was kind of small in terms of
number of shapes and very buggy.
Mix of C#, bash and lack of build automation did not
allow to effectively fix the problems.

Instead, this sprite library is based on
Enterprise Integration Pattern Shapes for Gliffy
https://github.com/comsysto/enterprise-integration-pattern-shapes-for-gliffy

It is a pure sprite library just as
standard Cloudinsight PlantUML sprites library
https://github.com/rabelenda/cicon-plantuml-sprites

The nice thing about sprite library vs macro/function library
is that you have much more control over appearance
when writing your diagram.

All sprites come in multiple sizes determined by sprite name
suffix:

.Sprite sizes
|===
|Suffix|Size

|Small|50
||100
|Large|200
